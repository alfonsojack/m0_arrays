# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel pretty confident. I guess I would love to see more practical applications to a lot of these array methods so that I can fully understand how they would be implemented in a project.
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I certainly will be practicing these different array methods and googling more info on them before I fully move on. I just want a fuller understanding of their applications. 
# What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I don't have any questions beyond what I already mentioned in previous comments.
